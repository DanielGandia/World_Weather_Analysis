## Overview

The request for this project was to use Google Maps Directions APIs to make the PlanMyTrip app in assist users identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. Once the top 4 desired destinations have been selected, the app will create a travel itinerary as well as provide the best routes between the cities. In the end, the app will display the current weather for those 4 locations. 

Below are the screenshots of the results:
